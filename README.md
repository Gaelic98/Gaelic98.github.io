## Welcome to my homepage

I am currenlty a PhD student at the University of Bath and part of the [CAMERA](https://www.camera.ac.uk/) research group. My reserch  involves computer vision for animal body analysis with a focus upon canines. My research interests include: 

1. Pose Estimation 
2. Part Segmentation 
3. Synthetic Data
4. Domain Adaptation
5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)



My initial work at the University of Bath concerned the area of human pose estiamtion and multi task learning. Early in my research my interest began to shift towatds the animal domain ans how we could apply techniques and models that had been used on human subjects to animals. Such a research area has provided my with a plethora of interesting projects as there is very little work in this area when comparing to humans, 

One of my first projects as part of this research considered a simplistic canine skelton model made up of 43 joints. Inspired by the work of [Kanazawa et.al.](https://akanazawa.github.io/hmr/) we used this model to generate syntehtic data using a set of 2D keypoints ofr images we had labelled ourselves. Please see [Canine Skeleton Reconstruction](https://github.com/Gaelic98/Gaelic98.github.io/blob/main/CSR.md) for more details.
